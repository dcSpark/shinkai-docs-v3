### How does Shinkai work?

Shinkai is an AI platform built to help you get things done—faster, smarter, and always up-to-date—all while keeping your data private. Here’s how it works:

1. **AI That Works Locally:**
Shinkai uses AI models that run directly on your device. Whether you need help organizing emails, summarizing documents, or managing your schedule, everything happens locally—meaning your personal data stays with you, not on a server.


2. **Real-Time Data Updates**
Unlike traditional AI models that rely on static, outdated data, Shinkai taps into real-time information. It connects to a decentralized network to access the latest knowledge, so your AI always has up-to-date insights.

3. **Decentralized and Private:**
Shinkai is powered by a network of independent computers called nodes. These nodes share fresh, AI-ready data while keeping your information secure with advanced tools like encryption and zero-knowledge proofs. This ensures your privacy while helping the AI stay current and accurate.


5. **Join the Shinkai Network:**
By registering a Shinkai identity (e.g., @@alice.shinkai), you can participate in the decentralized network. This connects your AI to up-to-date content from trusted sources, automatically improving its capabilities—all while ensuring your information remains private.
Shinkai offers a powerful, private AI assistant that adapts to your needs, evolves with the internet, and keeps your data under your control.
