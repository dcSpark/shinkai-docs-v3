Workflows are Shinkai Tools developed to streamline complex processes. 
They help users efficiently manage various AI-related operations by connecting multiple steps into one smooth flow.

This feature is particularly helpful for users who want to optimize their tasks without needing to handle every step individually.
## Basic

### Inline Code

To denote a `word` or `phrase` as code, enclose it in backticks (`).

```

### Code Block

Use [fenced code blocks](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks) by enclosing code in three backticks and follow the leading ticks with the programming language of your snippet to get syntax highlighting. Optionally, you can also write the name of your code after the programming language.

```java HelloWorld.java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
