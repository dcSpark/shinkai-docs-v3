   <Accordion icon="paperclip" title="Upload a file">
    You can upload files to the chat to help the AI understand specific contexts and to ensure getting more accurate responses.  
  </Accordion>
   <Accordion icon="sitemap" title="Add workflow">

### Files Manager
Shinkai offers you a dedicated view to create and manage folders, where you can store your files and include them in your interactions with your AI. 

**All your information remains in your device, maintaining your privacy.** 
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/file-manager.jpg" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</Frame>
Go to `My AI Files Explorer` on the left side menu. In this view you can add New Folders, Upload files and start chats directly by selecting the folder â€“or filesâ€“ you want to include in the conversation with your AI. 


### Subscriptions
The `Browse Subscriptions` feature in Shinkai allows users to subscribe to up-to-date content from various sources across the decentralized Shinkai Network. 
This option lets users enhance their AI's knowledge base by subscribing to folders of AI-ready content, such as news, sports, cryptocurrency updates, and even user-shared files like PDFs or websites.

<Tip>
When you subscribe to content, it will be stored in your `Al File Explorer`. It might take a few minutes to appear, although you can see updates in `My Subscriptions`.
</Tip>

Benefits of subscribing to up-to-date content:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Access to Dynamic Data">
By subscribing, your AI stays informed with continuously updated information. This is particularly valuable since most traditional AI systems rely on static or outdated data. The Shinkai network automatically updates subscribed content, ensuring your AI always has access to fresh insights.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Hands-Free Updates">
 Once subscribed, your content folders will automatically sync with any updates or new additions, allowing your AI to operate based on real-time information without manual intervention.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

This feature is part of Shinkai's broader vision of creating an AI-first decentralized network where data is continuously fed to AI models for better decision-making and real-world tasks.
