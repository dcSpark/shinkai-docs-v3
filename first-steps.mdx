Let's get down to the different options of the menu, to get you familiarized with the basic tools of Shinkai. 

### AI Chats
The first options of the side menu are reserved for chats. The first one leads you directly into a **new chat creation**, while the second opens the view of **all chats**. 

Notice that there are two tabs in the chats section: **active** and **archived**. You can archive a chat anytime you want. Just hover the chat and click the box icon.

When creating a new chat there are different settings you can adjust:

<AccordionGroup>

### Files Manager
Shinkai offers you a dedicated view to create and manage folders, where you can store your files and include them in your interactions with your AI. 
All your information remains in your device, maintaining your privacy. 
<Frame>

Go to **My AI Files Explorer** on the left side menu. In this view you can add New Folders, Upload files and start chats directly by selecting the folder –or files– you want to include in the conversation with your AI. 


### Subscriptions
The "Browse Subscriptions" feature in Shinkai allows users to subscribe to up-to-date content from various sources across the decentralized Shinkai Network. 
This option lets users enhance their AI's knowledge base by subscribing to folders of AI-ready content, such as news, sports, cryptocurrency updates, and even user-shared files like PDFs or websites.

Benefits of subscribing to up-to-date content:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Access to Dynamic Data">
By subscribing, your AI stays informed with continuously updated information. This is particularly valuable since most traditional AI systems rely on static or outdated data. The Shinkai network automatically updates subscribed content, ensuring your AI always has access to fresh insights.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Hands-Free Updates">
 Once subscribed, your content folders will automatically sync with any updates or new additions, allowing your AI to operate based on real-time information without manual intervention.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

This feature is part of Shinkai's broader vision of creating an AI-first decentralized network where data is continuously fed to AI models for better decision-making and real-world tasks.
