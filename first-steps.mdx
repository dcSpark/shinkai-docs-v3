  </Tab>
  <Tab title="4. AI Response Field">
    In this section you will see the AI chat response once you have prompted it with instructions or questions. 
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="4. Input Field">
    Here is where you ask your questions, and provide prompts to your local AI. There are some options that we'll review more in depth in the following section. 
  </Tab>

Let's get down to the different options of the menu, to get you familiarized with the basic tools of Shinkai. 

## AI Chats
The first options of the side menu are reserved for chats. The first one leads you directly into a **new chat creation**, while the second opens the view of **all chats**.

### Creating a new AI chat
When creating a new chat there are different settings you can adjust:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="robot" title="Select your AI model">
    The first dropdown menu displays all the models you have installed, allowing you to change from one model to the next easily. 
    Learn more about [AI Model installation here](/quickstart#setting-up-shinkai). 
  </Accordion>

   <Accordion icon="paperclip" title="Upload a file">
    You can upload files to the chat to help the AI understand specific contexts and to ensure getting more accurate responses.  
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="books" title="Prompts Library">
    Shinkai comes with an extensive list of ready-to-use prompts. Just click on the books icon and the list will appear on the right side of your app. 

    You can create new `custom prompts` by clicking the ‚ûï plus icon at the upper right corner.
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/prompt-library.jpg" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
    </Frame>  
  </Accordion>

   <Accordion icon="sitemap" title="Add workflow">
    Shinkai comes with algorithmic instructions ‚Äìor workflows‚Äì ready to use, helping you optimize tasks and processes. 
    Just click on the workflow icon and it will display the `Workflow Library` where you can select the workflow you'd like to apply in your prompt. 
    
    Clicking the ‚ûï plus icon at the top right corner will lead you to the [Worflow Playground](/advanced/workflows), where you can create custom workflows adapted to your needs. 
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/workflows.jpg" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
    </Frame>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="folder-closed" title="Local AI files">
    You can add your local files or folders to provide robust context to the AI. 
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="Sliders" title="Chat Settings">
    You can access chat settings to adjust how the model generates text. By adjusting these settings, you can fine-tune the balance between creativity and accuracy, depending on the nature of your project or conversation.
    ![Menu options](/images/chat-settings.jpg) 
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Enable Stream">
        This toggle allows you to turn on or off streaming mode. When enabled, the model will stream responses word by word or in chunks rather than delivering the full response at once. This can create a more dynamic, conversational experience.
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Temperature">
        The temperature controls the **randomness** of the AI‚Äôs responses.
    
          - A lower temperature (e.g., `0.2`) makes the model more deterministic, meaning it will generate more focused and repetitive responses.
          - A higher temperature (e.g., `0.8`) introduces more randomness and creativity, making the responses less predictable but possibly more diverse.
          - For balanced creativity and coherence, a temperature between `0.7` and `1.0` is commonly used.
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Top P (Nucleus Sampling)">
        - This setting affects how the model selects words based on cumulative probability.
        - `Top P` sets a threshold for considering the most likely word choices. For example, a `Top P` of `0.9` means the model will sample from the smallest possible set of words whose combined probability is 90%.
        - Lower `Top P` values result in more conservative responses, while higher values (closer to `1.0`) allow for more diversity.
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Top K">
        - `Top K` controls how many of the highest probability word choices are considered at each step.
        - For instance, `Top K = 40` means the model will only consider the top 40 most likely words, filtering out less probable options.
        - A lower `Top K` (e.g., `5` or `10`) will make the responses more deterministic, while a higher Top K (e.g., `50` or `100`) allows for more variety in responses.
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Custom Prompt">
        - This field allows you to input a custom prompt that adjusts the context or behavior of the AI.
        - You can add specific instructions here, such as ‚ÄúRespond concisely‚Äù or ‚ÄúAct as a friendly assistant,‚Äù which will influence how the AI interacts within the session.
      </Tab>
      </Tabs>
     
  </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>


### Files Manager
Shinkai offers you a dedicated view to create and manage folders, where you can store your files and include them in your interactions with your AI. 

**All your information remains in your device, maintaining your privacy.** 
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/file-manager.jpg" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</Frame>
Go to `My AI Files Explorer` on the left side menu. In this view you can add New Folders, Upload files and start chats directly by selecting the folder ‚Äìor files‚Äì you want to include in the conversation with your AI. 


### Subscriptions
The `Browse Subscriptions` feature in Shinkai allows users to **subscribe to up-to-date content from various sources** across the decentralized Shinkai Network. 
This option lets users enhance their AI's knowledge base by subscribing to folders of AI-ready content, such as news, sports, cryptocurrency updates, and even user-shared files like PDFs or websites.
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/subscriptions.jpg" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</Frame>

<Tip>
When you subscribe to content, it will be stored in your `Al File Explorer`. It might take a few minutes to appear, although you can see updates in `My Subscriptions`.
</Tip>

Benefits of subscribing to up-to-date content:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Access to Dynamic Data">
By subscribing, your AI stays informed with continuously updated information. This is particularly valuable since most traditional AI systems rely on static or outdated data. The Shinkai network automatically updates subscribed content, ensuring your AI always has access to fresh insights.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Hands-Free Updates">
 Once subscribed, your content folders will automatically sync with any updates or new additions, allowing your AI to operate based on real-time information without manual intervention.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

This feature is part of Shinkai's broader vision of creating an AI-first decentralized network where data is continuously fed to AI models for better decision-making and real-world tasks.
