**AI agents** are systems or programs designed to autonomously perform tasks, make decisions, and interact with their environments to achieve specific goals set by users. 

Unlike traditional chatbots, AI agents handle complex, multi-step tasks with minimal human input, continuously improving their performance. 

### How AI Agents Work
AI agents are designed to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable subtasks. 
They use knowledge from real-time data and learning to evaluate options and make decisions. 

### Shinkai's AI Agents
AI Agents in Shinkai work as follows:

1. **Task Input**: The agent receives a specific task or goal from a user.
2. **Information Acquisition**: The agent gathers necessary information from its knowledge, memory or external sources (tools).
3. **Task Decomposition**: The agent breaks down the main goal into smaller, manageable tasks.
4. **Execution**: The agent performs these tasks autonomously, adapting its approach as needed based on feedback and results from previous actions.
5. **Response Delivery**: The agent returns a response to the user, who also adapts and improve by prompting the agent. This process feeds the agent with new knowledge to improve its performance in the future.

## AI Agents vs. Traditional Chatbots
While both AI agents and chatbots rely on artificial intelligence, they differ significantly in task complexity, adaptability, and interaction style.

### Key Differences

|                                  | Chatbots (LLMs)                       | AI Agents                |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Task Execution**               | Rely on scripted workflows for simple, predefined tasks like answering FAQs. | Perform complex, multi-step tasks like planning trips, managing emails, or analyzing data, adapting based on user feedback. |
| **Learning and Adaptation**      | Have limited learning capabilities and struggle with new or complex scenarios. | Continuously learn from past interactions and adjust their responses dynamically, improving over time. |
| **Interaction Style**            | Provide generic, text-based responses, often failing to understand nuanced queries. | Use advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand context and provide personalized, human-like conversations across text, voice, and other formats. |

## Applications of AI Agents

AI agents are increasingly utilized across various fields, including:

- **Customer support**: AI agents are used in customer service to provide 24/7 support and handle inquiries, manage refunds, and offer product suggestions.
- **Data analysis and insights**: AI agents analyze large datasets to extract valuable insights and predict market trends and consumer behavior.
- **Personalized recommendations**: E-commerce platforms use AI agents for recommendation systems that suggest products based on user behavior and preferences.
- **Project management**: AI agents can optimize project management by scheduling tasks and allocating resources efficiently.
