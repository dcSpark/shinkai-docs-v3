**AI agents** are systems or programs designed to autonomously perform tasks, make decisions, and interact with their environments to achieve specific goals set by users. 

Unlike traditional chatbots, AI agents handle complex, multi-step tasks with minimal human input, continuously improving their performance.

## What Makes Something an AI Agent?

AI agents are distinguished by their ability to:

1. **Make autonomous decisions** about how to accomplish goals
2. **Use tools and external systems** to gather information or take actions
3. **Break down complex tasks** into manageable steps
4. **Learn from interactions** to improve future performance

### Workflows vs. Agents

When discussing AI agents, it's helpful to understand the distinction between two approaches:

- **Workflows**: Systems where AI models and tools follow predefined code paths and sequences
- **Agents**: Systems where AI models dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks

This distinction helps clarify when to use more structured approaches versus when to leverage the full autonomous capabilities of agents.

## How AI Agents Work

AI agents are designed to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable subtasks. 
They use knowledge from real-time data and learning to evaluate options and make decisions.

The typical process includes:

1. **Understanding the goal**: The agent interprets what the user wants accomplished
2. **Planning**: The agent creates a strategy to achieve the goal
3. **Executing actions**: The agent interacts with tools, APIs, or other resources
4. **Monitoring progress**: The agent evaluates results and adjusts its approach
5. **Completing the task**: The agent delivers the final result to the user

### Shinkai's AI Agents

AI Agents in Shinkai work as follows:

1. **Task Input**: The agent receives a specific task or goal from a user.
2. **Information Acquisition**: The agent gathers necessary information from its knowledge, memory or external sources (tools).
3. **Task Decomposition**: The agent breaks down the main goal into smaller, manageable tasks.
4. **Execution**: The agent performs these tasks autonomously, adapting its approach as needed based on feedback and results from previous actions.
5. **Response Delivery**: The agent returns a response to the user, who also adapts and improves by prompting the agent. This process feeds the agent with new knowledge to improve its performance in the future.

## When to Use AI Agents

AI agents are most valuable when:

- Tasks require multiple steps that can't be predetermined
- The goal is clear, but the exact path to achieve it may vary
- Access to external tools or data sources is needed
- The system needs to adapt to changing conditions or feedback

For simpler tasks with clear, predictable steps, a more structured workflow approach may be more efficient and reliable than a fully autonomous agent.

## AI Agents vs. Traditional Chatbots

While both AI agents and chatbots rely on artificial intelligence, they differ significantly in task complexity, adaptability, and interaction style.

### Key Differences

|                                  | Chatbots (LLMs)                       | AI Agents                |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Task Execution**               | Rely on scripted workflows for simple, predefined tasks like answering FAQs. | Perform complex, multi-step tasks like planning trips, managing emails, or analyzing data, adapting based on user feedback. |
| **Learning and Adaptation**      | Have limited learning capabilities and struggle with new or complex scenarios. | Continuously learn from past interactions and adjust their responses dynamically, improving over time. |
| **Interaction Style**            | Provide generic, text-based responses, often failing to understand nuanced queries. | Use advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand context and provide personalized, human-like conversations across text, voice, and other formats. |

## Applications of AI Agents

AI agents are increasingly utilized across various fields, including:

- **Customer support**: AI agents are used in customer service to provide 24/7 support, handle inquiries, manage refunds, and offer product suggestions.
- **Data analysis and insights**: AI agents analyze large datasets to extract valuable insights and predict market trends and consumer behavior.
- **Personalized recommendations**: E-commerce platforms use AI agents for recommendation systems that suggest products based on user behavior and preferences.
- **Project management**: AI agents can optimize project management by scheduling tasks and allocating resources efficiently.
- **Software development**: AI agents can assist with debugging, code review, and implementing solutions to technical issues.
- **Financial analysis**: AI agents can monitor market trends, detect anomalies, and provide investment recommendations.

## Building Blocks of AI Agents in Shinkai

In Shinkai, AI agents are constructed from several core components:

1. **AI Models**: The foundation of intelligence, ranging from local to cloud-based models
2. **System Prompts**: Instructions that guide the agent's behavior and focus
3. **Tools**: External capabilities that allow the agent to interact with systems and data
4. **Context**: Relevant documents and information the agent can access
5. **Memory**: The ability to retain information from previous interactions

By combining these elements effectively, Shinkai enables users to create powerful, purpose-built AI agents for specific tasks and workflows.
