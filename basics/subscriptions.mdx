## Overview
The `Browse Subscriptions` feature in Shinkai allows users to **subscribe to up-to-date content from various sources** across the decentralized Shinkai Network. 
This option lets users enhance their AI's knowledge base by subscribing to folders of AI-ready content, such as news, sports, cryptocurrency updates, and even user-shared files like PDFs or websites.

Benefits of subscribing to up-to-date content:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Access to Dynamic Data">
By subscribing, your AI stays informed with continuously updated information. This is particularly valuable since most traditional AI systems rely on static or outdated data. The Shinkai network automatically updates subscribed content, ensuring your AI always has access to fresh insights.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Hands-Free Updates">
 Once subscribed, your content folders will automatically sync with any updates or new additions, allowing your AI to operate based on real-time information without manual intervention.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

This feature is part of Shinkai's broader vision of creating an AI-first decentralized network where data is continuously fed to AI models for better decision-making and real-world tasks.

## Subscribing to Content
To subscribe to up-to-date content just click the `Browse Subscriptions` option on the leftside menu > Browse the list of resources > Click `Subscribe`.

<Tip>
When you subscribe to content, it will be stored in your `Al File Explorer`. It might take a few minutes to appear, although you can see updates in `My Subscriptions`.
</Tip>

## Accessing your Content
Once your subscription has been updated, Shinkai will pull the content and store it in `My AI Files Explorer` > `My Subscriptions`.

There is no need to open each file separately to find information. You can select files and chat with them directly in that folder.
