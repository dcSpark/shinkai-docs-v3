## AI Chats
The first options of the side menu are reserved for chats. The first one leads you directly into a **new chat creation**, while the second opens the view of **all chats**.

### Creating a new AI chat
When creating a new chat there are different settings you can adjust:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="robot" title="Select your AI model">
    The first dropdown menu displays all the models you have installed, allowing you to change from one model to the next easily. 
    Learn more about [AI Model installation here](/quickstart#setting-up-shinkai). 
  </Accordion>

   <Accordion icon="paperclip" title="Upload a file">
    You can upload files to the chat to help the AI understand specific contexts and to ensure getting more accurate responses.  
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="books" title="Prompts Library">
    Shinkai comes with an extensive list of ready-to-use prompts. Just click on the books icon and the list will appear on the right side of your app. 

    You can create new `custom prompts` by clicking the ➕ plus icon at the upper right corner.

    </Frame>  
  </Accordion>

   <Accordion icon="sitemap" title="Add workflow">
    Shinkai comes with algorithmic instructions –or workflows– ready to use, helping you optimize tasks and processes. 
    Just click on the workflow icon and it will display the `Workflow Library` where you can select the workflow you'd like to apply in your prompt. 
    
    Clicking the ➕ plus icon at the top right corner will lead you to the [Worflow Playground](/advanced/workflows), where you can create custom workflows adapted to your needs.

    </Frame>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="folder-closed" title="Local AI files">
    You can add your local files or folders to provide robust context to the AI. 
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="Sliders" title="Chat Settings">
    You can access chat settings to adjust how the model generates text. By adjusting these settings, you can fine-tune the balance between creativity and accuracy, depending on the nature of your project or conversation.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Enable Stream">
        This toggle allows you to turn on or off streaming mode. When enabled, the model will stream responses word by word or in chunks rather than delivering the full response at once. This can create a more dynamic, conversational experience.
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Temperature">
        The temperature controls the **randomness** of the AI’s responses.
    
          - A lower temperature (e.g., `0.2`) makes the model more deterministic, meaning it will generate more focused and repetitive responses.
          - A higher temperature (e.g., `0.8`) introduces more randomness and creativity, making the responses less predictable but possibly more diverse.
          - For balanced creativity and coherence, a temperature between `0.7` and `1.0` is commonly used.
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Top P (Nucleus Sampling)">
        - This setting affects how the model selects words based on cumulative probability.
        - `Top P` sets a threshold for considering the most likely word choices. For example, a `Top P` of `0.9` means the model will sample from the smallest possible set of words whose combined probability is 90%.
        - Lower `Top P` values result in more conservative responses, while higher values (closer to `1.0`) allow for more diversity.
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Top K">
        - `Top K` controls how many of the highest probability word choices are considered at each step.
        - For instance, `Top K = 40` means the model will only consider the top 40 most likely words, filtering out less probable options.
        - A lower `Top K` (e.g., `5` or `10`) will make the responses more deterministic, while a higher Top K (e.g., `50` or `100`) allows for more variety in responses.
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Custom Prompt">
        - This field allows you to input a custom prompt that adjusts the context or behavior of the AI.
        - You can add specific instructions here, such as “Respond concisely” or “Act as a friendly assistant,” which will influence how the AI interacts within the session.
