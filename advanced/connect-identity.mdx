After following [the previous documentation on registering your identity on-chain](/advanced/shinkai-identity), you should have your identity keys downloaded on your machine. 

Now we will move forward with connecting this identity, using the keys, to your Shinkai node (Shinkai Desktop).

<Note>
### Requirements

Before moving forward make sure you have Shinkai Desktop installed. If you don't, please reference the [Installation and Setup Guide](/quickstart) page for instructions.

Also, make sure you've registered an identity on-chain following the [Registering Your Shinkai Identity](/advanced/shinkai-identity) documentation. 

> You must follow the instructions and register an identity by clicking the link in Shinkai Desktop, not by registering an identity through the dApp directly (otherwise the correct keys from Shinkai Desktop will not be used when registering your identity).
