**Ollama** is an innovative Al platform designed to democratize access to large language models (LLMs) by allowing users to run these models locally on their machines. 
This capability enhances privacy and control over data, as it mitigates concerns associated with cloud-based solutions.

<Note>Note that all AI models in Shinkai are powered by Ollama. Before installing Ollama models manually, check the available models list for quick installation.</Note>
