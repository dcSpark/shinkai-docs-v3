## What is the Shinkai Network?

The Shinkai Network is a decentralized network that allows users to connect with each other directly, similar to how the internet works. It enables users to share content, data, and features securely and privately.

#### Benefits of having a Shinkai Identity

Having a Shinkai Identity on the Shinkai Network offers several benefits:

- Full p2p capabilities: With a Shinkai Identity, you can connect with others directly on the network, unlocking full peer-to-peer (p2p) capabilities.
- Access to exclusive features and content: By registering your identity on-chain, you'll gain access to a wide range of features, data, and content that become available for users on the Shinkai Network.
- Security and control: Your Shinkai Identity is tied to your wallet, making it easy to reset or manage if needed. This ensures that your identity remains secure and under your control.
- By registering your Shinkai Identity, you'll be able to take advantage of these benefits and become a part of the growing community on the Shinkai Network!


## How to Register your Shinkai Identity
Follow these simple steps to create and register a new "Shinkai Identity" on the Shinkai Network.

To do this, you need:

- A special computer program called an EVM-compatible wallet (like Metamask).
- The Shinkai Desktop software installed on your computer.
- Some special tokens called KAI that you can get for free from a website called the "faucet".


Here are the steps to register your Shinkai Identity:

1. Open Shinkai Desktop and click on the settings icon.
2. Click on the "Register your Shinkai Identity" link.
3. Connect your wallet (the EVM-compatible program) to the Shinkai Identity Registration webpage.
4. Enter a name for your identity (the longer the name, the fewer KAI tokens you need).
5. Download a special file that backs up your application keys.
6. Confirm that you have downloaded the file and then submit the transaction on-chain (this means sending it to the Shinkai Network).
7. Your wallet will ask you to confirm the transaction.
8. Once confirmed, you should see a screen to "Confirm" staking your KAI tokens to register your identity.
9. After the transaction confirms, you have officially registered your first Shinkai Identity!

Now that you've registered your Shinkai Identity, you can connect it to Shinkai Desktop and use it to access more features on the Shinkai Network.

Think of a Shinkai Identity like a special username or handle that represents you on the network. It's tied to your wallet, so you can easily reset or manage it if needed.

# Creating Your Shinkai Identity and Connecting to the Node

## Introduction
In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of creating your Shinkai identity and connecting your client device to the Shinkai node. This will allow you to interact with the node and utilize all that the Shinkai ecosystem has to offer. 

As a user, your privacy and security are paramount, and this process ensures that you can interact with the node while maintaining your anonymity. 

## Prerequisites
Before we begin, there are a few things you'll need:
- An EVM-compatible wallet, such as Metamask. This is required to interact with the Shinkai node and manage your keys securely. 
- Access to the Shinkai Desktop application. If you haven't already, you can download it from our website or the relevant app store. 

## Step 1: Register Your Shinkai Identity
The first step in the process is to register your Shinkai identity onchain. This is a crucial step as it ties your identity to the blockchain and allows you to interact with the node securely. 

1. Open Shinkai Desktop and click on the "Settings" tab. 
2. Click on the "Identity" section. 
3. You will see a link that says "Register Your Shinkai Identity." Click on this link, which will open the Shinkai Identity Registration webpage. 
4. On this webpage, your application's keys will be automatically filled out for you. This is to ensure a seamless and secure registration process. 
5. Press the "Connect Wallet" button and select the wallet that you used to receive tokens from the faucet. 
6. Once connected, you should see a confirmation message, indicating that your identity has been successfully registered onchain. 

## Step 2: Interact with the Node
Now that your identity is registered, you can start interacting with the Shinkai node. 

1. In the Shinkai Desktop application, click on the "Message" tab. This is where you will create and send messages to the node. 
2. In the message composition area, you will see a text box where you can input your message. Go ahead and type out your desired message. 
3. Once you're ready, click on the "Send" button to send your message to the node. 

## Step 3: Use Your Registration Code
During the registration process, you were given a registration code. This code is crucial in ensuring the security of your identity. 

1. When sending a message to the node, make sure to include your registration code. This can be done by adding it as part of the message content. 
2. The node will use this code to verify your identity and ensure that only authorized devices can interact with it. 

## Step 4: Save Your Keypairs
When you registered your identity, keypairs were generated for you. These keypairs are crucial in ensuring secure communication between your device and the node. 

1. After registering your identity, go to the "Security" tab in Shinkai Desktop. 
2. You should see a section that says "Your Keypairs." Here, you can view your public and private keys. 
3. Make sure to save these keypairs in a secure location. They will be required whenever you create and send messages to the node. 

## Step 5: Connect to the Node
Now that you have registered your identity and saved your keypairs, you can connect to the node. 

1. In the Shinkai Desktop application, click on the "Connection" tab. 
2. You will see a list of available nodes. Select the one you want to connect to by clicking on its corresponding button. 
3. Once connected, you should see a confirmation message, indicating that your device is now connected to the node. 

## Conclusion
By following these steps, you have successfully created your Shinkai identity and connected your client device to the Shinkai node. This ensures that you can interact with the node securely and privately, while maintaining your anonymity. 

Remember to keep your keypairs safe and secure, as they are crucial in ensuring a seamless connection between your device and the node.
