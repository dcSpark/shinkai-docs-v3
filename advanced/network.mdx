## What is the Shinkai Network?

The Shinkai Network is a decentralized network that allows users to connect with each other directly, similar to how the internet works. It enables users to share content, data, and features securely and privately.

#### Benefits of having a Shinkai Identity

Having a Shinkai Identity on the Shinkai Network offers several benefits:

- Full p2p capabilities: With a Shinkai Identity, you can connect with others directly on the network, unlocking full peer-to-peer (p2p) capabilities.
- Access to exclusive features and content: By registering your identity on-chain, you'll gain access to a wide range of features, data, and content that become available for users on the Shinkai Network.
- Security and control: Your Shinkai Identity is tied to your wallet, making it easy to reset or manage if needed. This ensures that your identity remains secure and under your control.
- By registering your Shinkai Identity, you'll be able to take advantage of these benefits and become a part of the growing community on the Shinkai Network!


## How to Register your Shinkai Identity
Follow these simple steps to create and register a new "Shinkai Identity" on the Shinkai Network.

To do this, you need:

- A special computer program called an EVM-compatible wallet (like Metamask).
- The Shinkai Desktop software installed on your computer.
- Some special tokens called KAI that you can get for free from a website called the "faucet".


Here are the steps to register your Shinkai Identity:

1. Open Shinkai Desktop and click on the settings icon.
2. Click on the "Register your Shinkai Identity" link.
3. Connect your wallet (the EVM-compatible program) to the Shinkai Identity Registration webpage.
4. Enter a name for your identity (the longer the name, the fewer KAI tokens you need).
5. Download a special file that backs up your application keys.
6. Confirm that you have downloaded the file and then submit the transaction on-chain (this means sending it to the Shinkai Network).
7. Your wallet will ask you to confirm the transaction.
8. Once confirmed, you should see a screen to "Confirm" staking your KAI tokens to register your identity.
9. After the transaction confirms, you have officially registered your first Shinkai Identity!

Now that you've registered your Shinkai Identity, you can connect it to Shinkai Desktop and use it to access more features on the Shinkai Network.

Think of a Shinkai Identity like a special username or handle that represents you on the network. It's tied to your wallet, so you can easily reset or manage it if needed.
