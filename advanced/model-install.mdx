## Installing AI Models Manually
Shinkai supports a variety of AI models, both local (via Ollama) and cloud-based. You can easily add any supported model:

> Click the `AIs` option on the left side menu > Click the `+ Manually Add AI` button on the upper-right corner.

<Tip>
  Shinkai makes it easy. Endpoints and models are already filled out for you. You just need to provide the API Key (except for Ollama) > Select the provider and model you'd like to install and you're done. 
</Tip>
