## Installing Local AIs Manually
The list of AI models in Shinkai is powered by Ollama and is continously growing. Although, if you want to install another model, you can do it easily:

> Click the `AIs` option on the left side menu > Click the `+ Manually Add AI` button on the upper-right corner.

<Tip>
  Shinkai makes it easy. Endpoints and models are already filled out for you. You just need to provide the API Key (except for Ollama) > Select the provider and model you'd like to install and you're done. 
</Tip>
