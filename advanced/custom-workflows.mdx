The Shinkai `Workflow Playground` is a user-friendly interface where you can define, test, and iterate workflows for your AI agents. 
It leverages the `Shinkai DSL`, a language designed specifically for building sequences of tasks that your agents can perform.


## Shinkai's DSL

**Shinkai’s Domain-Specific Language (DSL)** is designed to help you easily create workflows that guide an AI agent through a series of tasks. 
Here's a quick step-by-step guide on how to use it. 



<Expandable title="DSL Syntax Cheat Sheet">
    This cheat sheet provides a concise reference for Shinkai’s DSL, covering the core elements you need to create workflows.

    #### 1. Workflow
    Defines the overall process and its steps.

    ```markup Example
    workflow WorkflowName v1.0 {
        // steps go here
    }
    ```

    #### 2. Step
    Each workflow contains steps that define individual actions or tasks.

    ```markup Example
    step StepName {
        // step body with actions, conditions, or loops
    }
    ```

    #### 3. Step Body
    The body of each step contains actions, conditions, register operations, or loops.

    ```markup Example
    step_body = { (condition | register_operation | action | for_loop)+ }
    ```
    
    #### 4. Condition
    Conditions allow the workflow to perform actions based on logical checks (e.g., if a value is true).

    ```markup Example
    if $expression {
        // actions to execute if the condition is true
    }
    ```

    #### 5. Loop
    A loop runs a set of actions for each item in a list or within a range.

    ```markup Example
    for $item in $list {
        // actions for each item
    }
    ```

    #### 6. Action
    Actions are individual commands or external function calls executed by the workflow.

    ```markup Example
    action = { external_fn_call | command(param1, param2, ...) }
    ```

    #### 7. Function Call
    Functions let you perform pre-built tasks. They are called using `call` followed by the function name and any required parameters.

    ```markup Example
    $result = call function_name($param1, $param2)
    ```

    #### 8. Registers
    Registers store intermediate values. These values are prefixed by $ and can hold strings, numbers, booleans, etc.

    ```markup Example
    $R1 = "value" // Register for storing a string, number, etc.
    ```

    #### 9. Register Operation
    A register operation assigns a value or result from a function to a register.

    ```markup Example
    $R1 = call some_function($param)
    ```

 <Expandable title="Expression Components">
    #### 1. Comparison Operators
    Comparison operators are used in conditions to compare values.

    ```
    ==  // equal to
    !=  // not equal to
    >   // greater than
    <   // less than
    >=  // greater than or equal to
    <=  // less than or equal to

    ```

    #### 2. Range Expression
    A range expression is used to define a sequence of numbers or items.

    ```
    identifier1..identifier2

    ```

    #### 3. Simple Expressions
    Simple expressions are basic values like identifiers, numbers, strings, booleans, or registers.

    ```
    $R1  // A register
    123  // A number
    "Text" // A string

    ```


 </Expandable>

 <Expandable title="Data Types and Literals">
    #### 1. Strings
    Text values are enclosed in double quotes.

    ```
    "some text"
    ```

    #### 2. Numbers
    Use digits to define numbers.

    ```
    12345
    ```

    #### 3. Booleans
    Boolean values are either `true` or `false`.

    ```
    true
    false
    ```

    #### 4. Identifiers
    Identifiers are alphanumeric strings or underscores used for names (e.g., variable names, workflow names).

    ```
    identifier = [A-Z, a-z, 0-9, _]
    ```

    #### 5. Delimiters
    Characters used to separate parts of a string into individual components, e.g. `{ "\"" ~ (!"\"" ~ ANY)* ~ "\"" }`

    ```Markup Example
    $LOG = "INFO|2024-09-20|Server started"
    $LOG_PARTS = $LOG.split("|")  // Result: ["INFO", "2024-09-20", "Server started"]

    ```

### How to write a workflow with DSL

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Defining a workflow">
    Every workflow starts with `workflow`, followed by its name and version.
    ```Markup Example
    workflow WebProcess v0.1 {
        // steps go here
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adding Steps">
    Each step starts with the word `step` followed by the step name.
    ```Markup Example
    step Initialize {
        $PROMPT = "You are an expert summarizer..."
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Using Registers (Variables)">
    Registers (variables) store information. They start with `$`.
    Example:
        - `$PROMPT` stores a string.
        - `$CONTENT` stores downloaded data.
    ```Markup Example
        $PROMPT = "Summarize the webpage content"
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Calling External Functions">
    External functions let you use pre-built commands to perform tasks, like downloading data or processing information. The function is called with `call`.
    ```Markup Example
        $CONTENT = call download_webpage_and_save_as_markdown($INPUT)
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Conditions">
    Use `if` statements to run actions only when certain conditions are met.
    ```Markup Example
    if $TRANSACTION.value > 100 {
        // actions go here
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Loops">
    Use `for` loops to repeat actions for a list of items.
    ```Markup Example
    for $item in $list {
        // actions go here
    }
    ```
  </Step>

</Steps>

#### Example Workflow
Here’s a complete example of a workflow that initializes a task, downloads webpage data, and summarizes it:
```
workflow WebProcess v0.1 {
    step Initialize {
        $PROMPT = "You are an expert summarizer. Summarize the webpage content in markdown format."
    }
    step Download {
        $CONTENT = call download_webpage_and_save_as_markdown($INPUT)
    }
    step Summarize {
        $RESULT = call inference($PROMPT, $CONTENT)
    }
}
```
In this example:

- **Step 1** (`Initialize`): Sets up the task with a prompt for the AI.
- **Step 2** (`Download`): Downloads webpage content using an external function.
- **Step 3** (`Summarize`): Uses the AI to summarize the content based on the prompt.

## Building Workflows with BAML
**BAML** is a domain-specific language designed to simplify the creation and testing of large language model (LLM) functions. 

It treats prompts as functions with defined input variables and outputs, making it significantly faster than traditional Python-based testing environments. BAML supports multiple languages, ensures type safety, and provides real-time prompt previews. 

**You can easily create workflows in Shinkai using BAML**. You can test your functions in the [BAML playground](https://www.promptfiddle.com/) for instant feedback. 

For more information about BAML, explore their documentation [here](https://docs.boundaryml.com/docs/get-started/what-is-baml).

By following these simple guidelines, you can easily create powerful workflows with Shinkai DSL and BAML!

## Enabling/Disabling Workflows
Workflows can be enabled and disabled at convenience. To do this, simply go to `Shinkai Tools`, browse the list and switch the `toggle` on/off to enable/disable them.
