## What are Sheets in Shinkai?

`Shinkai Sheets` are spreadsheets embedded in your **Shinkai Desktop app**, just like Google Sheets, but empowered with artificial intelligence that help you optimize tasks with just a few clicks. 


## Creating a New Sheet
You can create a Sheet from scratch, adding columns and rows manually, or import a **CSV** or **XLSX** file to interact with them with AI.

### Columns Data
When creating a new column in Sheets, you can select different data types. If you want to apply AI, select the `AI Generated` option > Choose your AI model > Write your prompt.

  <img src="/images/sheet-new.jpg"  style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}/>
</Frame>

<Tip>
When writing a prompt for the AI Generated column, make sure to start with a `=`followed by the instruction.
For example, if you want to concatenate the prompt with another column, the syntax should be like this: `="First part of the prompt" + {Col} + ". Second part of the prompt"`.

If you are using a workflow, you can just type the column you want the workflow to work on, e.g., `=B`. 
</Tip>


## Interacting with Sheets
Here is an example of how to use the `AI Generated` option concatenating a prompt and a column.

### Applying Workflows to Sheets
You can create [workflows](/advanced/workflows) to automate tasks, connecting mutliple steps in a single flow and use them to interact with your Sheets in Shinkai. 
Here's a brief example:
