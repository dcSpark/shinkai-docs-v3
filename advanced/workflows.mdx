`Playground` is a **Shinkai Tool** developed to streamline complex processes by creating custom workflows or tools. 
It help users efficiently manage various AI-related operations by connecting multiple steps into one smooth flow.

This feature is particularly helpful for users who want to optimize their tasks without needing to handle every step individually.

Shinkai comes with a variety of pre-created workflows that you can browse directly in [Shinkai's wokflow library](/first-steps#workflow-library). 

### Why Use the Shinkai Playground?
- **Efficiency**: Create, test, and refine workflows faster.
- **Flexibility**: Customize your [agents](/basics/ai-agents)' behaviors without needing deep technical knowledge.
- **Seamless Integration**: Easily connect your workflows with APIs and external services through function calls.
- **Scalability**: Build workflows that can handle complex, multi-step processes.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="3. Select your AI">

 >*You can test the same workflow with different AIs to see which one performs best.* 
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="4. Set chat context">
  In order to test your workflow you need to provide some context. You can attach a file from your [local AI files](/basics/files-manager) or upload one from your device. 
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="5. Output">
  In this section you will see the output of the workflow once you test it. 
</Accordion>
