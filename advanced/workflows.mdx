`Workflows` are **Shinkai Tools** developed to streamline complex processes. 
They help users efficiently manage various AI-related operations by connecting multiple steps into one smooth flow.

This feature is particularly helpful for users who want to optimize their tasks without needing to handle every step individually.

Shinkai comes with a variety of pre-created workflows that you can browse directly in [Shinkai's wokflow library](/first-steps#workflow-library). 

### Why Use the Shinkai Workflow Playground?
- Efficiency: Create, test, and refine workflows faster.
- Flexibility: Customize your agents' behaviors without needing deep technical knowledge.
- Seamless Integration: Easily connect your workflows with APIs and external services through function calls.
- Scalability: Build workflows that can handle complex, multi-step processes.

## Workflow Playground Overview
Let's review the **Workflow Playground's UI** to help you navigate it with ease.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="1. Tell us what you want to do">
 Provide your Workflow a name, e.g., summarize text, forecast data, etc.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="2. Workflow">
Here you need to add the instructions for your workflow. To do this you need to apply `Shinkai's DSL` which we will see in depth in the next section. 
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="3. Select your AI">
 Choose the local AI you want to test your workflow with. Learn more about AI models [here](/advanced/custom-ai). 
 
 >*You can test the same workflow with different AIs to see which one performs best.* 
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="4. Set chat context">
  In order to test your workflow you need to provide some context. You can attach a file from your Local AI Files or upload one from your device. 
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="5. Workflow display">
  In this section you will see the output of the workflow once you test it. 
</Accordion>

## Building Custom Workflows
The Shinkai `Workflow Playground` is a user-friendly interface where you can define, test, and iterate workflows for your AI agents. 
It leverages the `Shinkai DSL`, a language designed specifically for building sequences of tasks that your agents can perform.
