This guide will walk you through the process of setting up your Twitter account for integration with Shinkai Tools, allowing you to post directly from the chat interface or through agents.

## Step 1: Create a Twitter Account

First, ensure you have a Twitter account. If you don't already have one, visit [Twitter's signup page](https://twitter.com/signup) and follow the registration process.

In the Developer Portal, locate and navigate to "User Authentication Settings" in your project settings.

## Step 5: Configure App Permissions and URLs

Set the app permissions to "Read and Write" and select "Native App" as the app type. 

For the configuration, set the Callback URL and Website URL as shown in the example below. These are essential for the authentication flow.

### Configuration Settings Table

Use the following settings when configuring your Twitter app:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| App Permissions | Read and Write |
| App Type | Native App |
| Callback URI / Redirect URL | https://secrets.shinkai.com/redirect |
| Website URL | shinkai.com |

Make sure to enter these values exactly as shown in the table above. The callback URI is particularly important for the authentication flow to work correctly.


## Step 6: Obtain API Credentials

After saving your settings, locate and copy both the CLIENT ID and CLIENT SECRET. Keep these secure as they will be used to authenticate your application.
