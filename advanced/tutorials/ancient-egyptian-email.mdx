# Building an Ancient Egyptian Email Assistant

This tutorial guides you through creating an automated email response system using Shinkai Tools. We'll implement an assistant that responds to emails with the personality of an ancient Egyptian pharaoh, demonstrating the power and flexibility of Shinkai's tool system.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial:
1. Install and open Shinkai Desktop
2. Enable experimental features in Settings
3. Have an email account with IMAP/SMTP access that supports secure connections (SSL/TLS)
4. Enable two-factor authentication and generate an app-specific password if supported by your provider

## Email Tool Configuration

First, configure the Email Fetcher and Email Sender tools in the Shinkai Tools section. These are native tools that work out of the box - no additional imports required.

### Email Tool Configuration

Both the Email Fetcher and Email Sender are native Shinkai tools that can be configured directly through the Tool Config page in the Shinkai Desktop app. No additional setup or environment configuration is required.

#### Email Fetcher Setup
In the Tool Config page:
1. Enable the Email Fetcher tool
2. Configure your IMAP settings:
   - Server and port (SSL/TLS required)
   - Authentication credentials
   - Use app-specific passwords when available

#### Email Sender Setup
In the same Tool Config page:
1. Enable the Email Sender tool
2. Configure your SMTP settings:
   - Server and port (SSL/TLS required)
   - Authentication credentials
   - Use app-specific passwords when available

Note: For enhanced security, always use SSL/TLS connections and app-specific passwords when supported by your email provider. The tool automatically handles secure connections and credential management.

## Creating the Email Assistant

To create your email assistant tool:

1. Navigate to the Tool Editor:
   - Open Shinkai Desktop
   - Click the wrench and screwdriver icon (Shinkai Tools) in the left sidebar
   - Click the red "Create Tool" button at the top of the page

2. In the Tool Editor:
   - The left panel contains a chat interface for initial prompts
   - The right panel shows the code editor
   - Below is the testing section for running your tool

3. Start with a prompt:
   - In the left chat panel, describe your tool
   - Example: "Create an email assistant that responds with an ancient Egyptian pharaoh personality"
   - The LLM will generate initial code based on your prompt

4. Configure dependencies:
   - Select required tools from the dropdown menu:
     * Email Fetcher (for retrieving emails)
     * Email Sender (for sending responses)
     * LLM Prompt Processor (for generating responses)
     * SQLite Query Executor (for tracking responses)

5. Review and test:
   - Examine the generated code in the editor
   - Make any necessary adjustments
   - Click "Apply Changes" to update
   - Use the testing section to verify functionality

### Core Components Flow

The email assistant follows a carefully orchestrated sequence of operations to process incoming emails and generate responses. Here's how the process flows:

1. **Email Fetching and Initial Processing**
   First, we retrieve new emails from the configured inbox using the Email Fetcher tool. This step includes validation to ensure we only process emails with complete information:
```typescript
try {
    // Retrieve and validate emails
    let { emails, login_status } = await emailFetcher({
        from_date: inputs.from_date || '',
        to_date: inputs.to_date || '',
    });

    // Filter valid emails and check date range
    emails = emails
        .filter((e: EMAIL) => (e.date && e.sender && e.subject))
        .filter((e: EMAIL) => e.date > (minDate?.toISOString() || '1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z'));

    // Check for previously answered emails using parameterized query
    const answeredEmailsQuery = await shinkaiSqliteQueryExecutor({
        query: 'SELECT * FROM answered_emails WHERE email_unique_id = ?',
        params: [emailUniqueId]
    });
    if (!answeredEmailsQuery?.result) {
        throw new Error('Failed to query answered emails');
    }
    const answeredEmails = (answeredEmailsQuery.result as ANSWERED_EMAIL_REGISTER[]) ?? [];
} catch (error) {
    console.error(`Failed to process emails: ${error}`);
    throw error;
}
```

2. **Duplicate Response Prevention**
   For each retrieved email, we generate a unique identifier based on its content and check our database to prevent duplicate responses. This ensures we never send multiple responses to the same email:
```typescript
try {
    for (const email of emails) {
        // Skip if we've already answered this email
        const emailUniqueId = await generateEmailUniqueId(email);
        if (answeredEmails.find(ae => ae.email_unique_id === emailUniqueId)) {
            continue;
        }
```

3. **Response Generation Loop**
   Once we've identified new, unanswered emails, we process each one in a loop. For each email:
   - Generate a unique identifier
   - Check if we've already responded
   - If it's a new email, generate a personalized response using the LLM
   
Here's how we generate the response using our ancient Egyptian personality:
```typescript
// Use LLM to create a response in the ancient Egyptian style
const response = await shinkaiLlmPromptProcessor({
    format: 'text',
    prompt: `You are a helpful email answering system.
    Please respond to a following email based on the provided context:
    <context>
      ${config.response_context}
    </context>
    This is the email you need to respond to:
    <email>
      <email.subject>${email.subject}</email.subject>
      <email.sender>${email.sender}</email.sender>
      <email.date>${email.date}</email.date>
      <email.text>${email.text}</email.text>
    </email>`,
});
```

4. **Response Delivery and Recording**
   After generating a response, we complete two final steps atomically to ensure consistency:
   - Send the response to the original sender
   - Record the response in our database to prevent duplicate replies
   
Here's the implementation:
```typescript
// Send the response
await sendEmail({
    recipient_email: email.sender,
    subject: 'RE:' + email.subject,
    body: response.message
});

// Record the response in the database using parameterized query
await shinkaiSqliteQueryExecutor({
    query: 'INSERT INTO answered_emails (email_unique_id, subject, email, response) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)',
    params: [emailUniqueId, email.subject, email.sender, response.message]
});
```

If any step fails, the error handling ensures:
- The current email processing is skipped
- Other emails can still be processed
- Errors are logged for debugging
- No duplicate responses are sent

## Tool Configuration

The tool's behavior is defined by its metadata. Here are the key configuration fields:

```json
{
  "configurations": {
    "properties": {
      "response_context": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The context to guide the email responses"
      }
    }
  },
  "parameters": {
    "properties": {
      "from_date": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The starting date for fetching emails in DD-Mon-YYYY format"
      },
      "to_date": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The ending date for fetching emails in DD-Mon-YYYY format"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Response Generation and Personality

The heart of our email assistant is its ability to generate personalized responses with an ancient Egyptian flair. For each new email that hasn't been answered yet, we follow this process:

1. **Email Processing Loop**
   The tool iterates through each email, checking if it needs a response:
   - First, verify if the email is new using its unique ID
   - If we've already answered it, skip to the next email
   - If it's new, proceed with generating a response

2. **Personality Integration**
   The ancient Egyptian personality comes from the response_context configuration:
   - This context guides the LLM's response style
   - Every response maintains the character of Khufur, the trapped pharaoh
   - The personality remains consistent across all email responses

1. **Email Processing Loop**
   ```typescript
   try {
       for (const email of emails) {
           // Skip if we've already answered this email
           const emailUniqueId = await generateEmailUniqueId(email);
           if (answeredEmails.find(ae => ae.email_unique_id === emailUniqueId)) {
               continue;
           }
   ```
   Each iteration:
   - Generates a unique ID for the email
   - Checks if we've already responded
   - Processes only new, unanswered emails

3. **LLM Response Generation**
   For each new email, we structure the content in XML format and combine it with our personality context. The LLM then:
   - Receives the email content in a structured format
   - Processes it alongside the pharaoh personality context
   - Generates a response that maintains Khufur's character
   
Here's how we combine the email content with our personality:
   ```typescript
   const response = await shinkaiLlmPromptProcessor({
       format: 'text',
       prompt: `You are a helpful email answering system.
       Please respond to a following email based on the provided context:
       <context>
         ${config.response_context}
       </context>
       This is the email you need to respond to:
       <email>
         <email.subject>${email.subject}</email.subject>
         <email.sender>${email.sender}</email.sender>
         <email.date>${email.date}</email.date>
         <email.text>${email.text}</email.text>
       </email>`,
   });
   ```

3. **Personality Injection**
   The ancient Egyptian personality comes from the response_context:
   ```typescript
   const config = {
       response_context: `
       You are an ancient pharaoh mummy named Khufur that's been trapped 
       for thousands of years in your cursed sarcophagus. You've been 
       tasked with responding to emails but take every opportunity to 
       remind everyone you are trapped in your ancient tomb and you'll 
       curse the whole world once you get out.
       `
   };
   ```

4. **Response Handling and Storage**
   Once the LLM generates a response with Khufur's personality, we complete the process by:
   - Sending the response back to the original sender
   - Recording it in our database to prevent duplicate responses
   - Handling any errors that might occur during sending or storage
   
Here's how we handle the final steps:
   ```typescript
   try {
       // Send the response
       await sendEmail({
           recipient_email: email.sender,
           subject: 'RE:' + email.subject,
           body: response.message
       });

       // Record in database with parameterized query
       await shinkaiSqliteQueryExecutor({
           query: 'INSERT INTO answered_emails (email_unique_id, subject, email, response) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)',
           params: [emailUniqueId, email.subject, email.sender, response.message]
       });
   } catch (error) {
       console.error(`Failed to process email: ${error}`);
       continue; // Skip problematic emails
   }
   ```

This complete process ensures:
- Each email gets a unique, personalized response in Khufur's voice
- The LLM consistently maintains the ancient Egyptian personality
- No email receives duplicate responses
- Failed processing doesn't block other emails
- All successful responses are properly recorded
- The system maintains a reliable state throughout the process
