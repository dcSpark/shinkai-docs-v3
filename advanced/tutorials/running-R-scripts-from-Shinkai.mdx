## Introduction

In this tutorial you will build a tool to quickly run R scripts from Shinkai, and use it to easily interact with your scripts text outputs via a LLM.

You will learn how to :

* use an executable path to run another software from Shinkai
* use LLMs to interact with your R scripts text outputs
* build the tool using Shinkai AI-assisted tool builder
* code the tool
* integrate error logging at each step

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial :
1. Install and open Shinkai Desktop
2. Install R
3. Create an R project with at least 1 script
4. Note these 3 paths : Rscript executable, R script to run, R project root directory

This tutorial is split into 3 parts, and you can skip to the one that interests you without missing essential context.

Note : The purpose of the path of the project root directory in input is to ensure the R script runs with its original working directory context, which helps maintain reliable file access patterns, especially if the R script uses relative file paths (e.g. data/file.csv). Without this, the script would still execute, but its ability to find and interact with project files would be compromised. Well organised R projects do use a project root directory and relative file paths to keep things organised and functional.


## Part 1 : Building a R script executor tool using Shinkai AI-assisted tool builder

Shinkai offers an effortless tool building experience thanks to its AI-assisted tool builder, where even libraries dependencies and tool metadata are handled automatically.

In the tool creation UI :
* select a performant LLM (e.g., shinkai_code_gen, shinkai_free_trial, gpt_4_1)
* select a programming language (we'll use Python in this tutorial)
* write a prompt describing the tool well and execute it

![R script executor prompt](/images/R_script_executor_builder_prompt.png)

For a good result your prompt should be detailed and clearly describe :
* the task the tool should accomplish and how
* what you would want in configuration versus inputs
* how to handle errors

Below is an example of a promt to generate a full prototype of the R script executor tool. It uses tags to make things clear for the LLM.

```text Prompt [expandable]
<task>
Create a tool to exectute R scripts from their project root directory using the Rscript executable, and log their outputs and errors.
</task>

<input instructions>
The tool has 2 inputs, both in string format.
The path of the R script.
The path of the R project root directory.
</input instructions>

<configuration instructions>
1 configurations : the path to the Rscript executable. String format.
</configuration instructions>

<instructions>
Make sure to run a clean R environment.
</instructions>

<error logging instructions>
Implement good error logging at each step.
Check one by one that the provided files and folders paths exist, collect the errors for all and show all errors if there are several.
Display error if the R script execution fails.
Make all error messages clear and informative.
</error logging instructions>

<output instructions>
The tool has 2 outputs : the output of the R script execution, and the error messages.
</output instructions>
```

Such prompt can create the tool successfully.
At the very least, it should create a good code flow for the intended tool, from which you can debug, edit, improve (both using prompts and manual code editing).
If you get error messages, you can copy paste them to the AI assistance eventually with added instructions and it should be able to fix the tool.
Once the tool is working, make sure to edit the metadata to make it as informative and useful as possible.

Below is the detailed code and metadata of a R script executor tool.

## Part 2 : Full code for a R script executor tool

The tool does the following :

* sets up configuration, input, and output classes

* checks if R executable, script, and project directory exist

* switches to the project directory

* prepares and runs the R script using subprocess

* captures outputs and errors from the script

* returns to the original directory

* returns the results (success/failure, output, errors)

Here is an annotated code for the tool, including explanations for all steps.

```python Full Code [expandable]
from typing import List  # Imports the List type for type hinting
import subprocess  # Allows us to run external programs like R
import os  # Provides functions to interact with the operating system
import os.path  # Gives us tools to work with file paths

# Configuration class to hold settings
class CONFIG:
    r_executable_path: str  # Path to the Rscript program executable
    # This class holds the location of the R program on your computer.
    # Example: r_executable_path = "C:\Program Files\R\R-4.3.3\bin\Rscript.exe"
    # Rscript is specifically designed for command-line execution of R scripts.

# Input class to hold the parameters needed for running the script
class INPUTS:
    r_script_path: str  # Path to the R script file we want to run
    # This is where your R script (.R file) is located
    # Example: r_script_path = "C:\Users\gille\Desktop\shinkai_test\scripts\mtcars_model_example.R"
    
    project_root_directory: str  # Directory where the project is located
    # This is the main folder of your project
    # Example: project_root_directory = "C:\Users\gille\Desktop\shinkai_test"

# Output class to hold the results
class OUTPUT:
    status: str  # Will hold "success" or "failure" message
    printed_output: str  # Will store any text output from the R script
    error_message: List[str]  # Will store a list of error messages that occur
    # This class collects all results and errors from running the R script

# The main function that runs the R script
async def run(config: CONFIG, inputs: INPUTS) -> OUTPUT:
    # This is an async function, which means it can run without blocking other code
    # It takes configuration and input parameters and returns an output object
    
    output = OUTPUT()  # Create a new empty output object to store results
    errors = []  # Create an empty list to collect any error messages
    
    # Safety check 1: Make sure the R program exists at the specified path
    if not os.path.isfile(config.r_executable_path):
        # os.path.isfile checks if a file exists at the given location
        # If the R program isn't found, add an error message to our list
        errors.append(f"R executable path does not exist: {config.r_executable_path}")
    
    # Safety check 2: Make sure the R script exists at the specified path
    if not os.path.isfile(inputs.r_script_path):
        # If the R script file isn't found, add an error message
        errors.append(f"R script path does not exist: {inputs.r_script_path}")
    
    # Safety check 3: Make sure the project directory exists
    if not os.path.isdir(inputs.project_root_directory):
        # os.path.isdir checks if a directory (folder) exists
        # If the project folder isn't found, add an error message
        errors.append(f"Project root directory does not exist: {inputs.project_root_directory}")
    
    # If there are any errors, store them and return without running the script
    if errors:
        output.error_message = errors  # Store all errors as a list
        output.status = "Failure : see error messages"  # Set status to failure
        return output  # Return early - don't try to run the script
    
    # Save the current working directory so we can go back to it later
    original_working_directory = os.getcwd()  # getcwd = get current working directory
    
    # Change to the project directory before running the R script
    os.chdir(inputs.project_root_directory)  # chdir = change directory
    
    try:
        # This try/except block helps catch any unexpected errors
        
        # Determine the null device based on the operating system
        # A null device is where we can send output we want to ignore
        null_device = "NUL" if os.name == "nt" else "/dev/null"
        # "nt" means Windows, which uses "NUL" as its null device
        # Other systems (like Mac/Linux) use "/dev/null"
        
        # Escape the R script path for Windows by doubling backslashes
        # This prevents Windows-style paths like "C:\folder" from causing errors
        escaped_r_script_path = inputs.r_script_path.replace("\\", "\\\\")
        
        # Build the R command to suppress extra PDF files
        # When R generates plots, it might save them as PDFs, especially when run from python
        # We send these to the null device to avoid cluttering the directory
        r_command = f"pdf('{null_device}'); source('{escaped_r_script_path}'); dev.off()"
        # pdf() - starts a PDF device to capture plots
        # source() - runs the R script
        # dev.off() - closes the PDF device
        
        # Start the R program with our script using subprocess
        process = subprocess.Popen(
            [config.r_executable_path, "--no-save", "--vanilla", "-e", r_command],
            # These arguments tell R:
            # --no-save: don't save the workspace when exiting
            # --vanilla: don't load/save preferences
            # -e: execute the provided command
            stdout=subprocess.PIPE,  # Capture standard output (print statements)
            stderr=subprocess.PIPE   # Capture error messages
        )
        
        # Wait for the process to finish and get its output
        stdout, stderr = process.communicate()
        # communicate() waits for the process to complete and
        # returns the captured output and error messages
        
        # Check if the script ran successfully
        if process.returncode != 0:
            # A return code of 0 means success, anything else is an error
            # If not successful, store the error message
            output.error_message = [f"R script execution failed with error: {stderr.decode('utf-8')}"]
            # decode('utf-8') converts the binary output to readable text
            output.status = "Failure : see error messages"
        else:
            # If successful, store the output
            output.printed_output = stdout.decode('utf-8')
            output.status = "Success"
            
    except Exception as e:
        # This catches any other unexpected errors that might occur
        output.error_message = [f"An error occurred while executing the R script: {str(e)}"]
        output.status = "Failure : see error messages"
        
    finally:
        # The finally block always runs, whether there was an error or not
        # Always go back to the original directory
        os.chdir(original_working_directory)
    
    # Return the results object with all output and error information
    return output
```

And here is good metadata for the tool. Make sure to :
* Give concrete examples for inputs and configurations. Be super explicit (e.g. example of a R script file path). It helps users and yourself know or recall the precise formats (or values, options, etc.) required or possible.
* Pick useful keywords.
* Write a clear but thorough tool description.

## Part 3 : Using the tool, interacting with R scripts text outputs from Shinkai

First, enter your Rscript executable path in the tool configuration.

![R script executor configuration](/images/R_script_executor_configuration.png)

In Shinkai chat you can use the tool :
* select an adequate LLM : a performant LLM able to understand complex and potentially long context (especially if executing advanced R scripts), or a tailored LLM specifically performant on the type of outputs your R script creates
* type '/' to access the list of available tools
* select the R Script Executor tool
* add your 2 inputs paths : R script and R project root directory
* add a prompt to interact with the text outputs of the R script
* press 'enter' or click on the arrow to send

![R script executor usage](/images/R_script_executor_usage.png)

When you execute the tool, the full text output (a.k.a. prints, or console logs) of your R script execution is passed as context to the LLM answering you. This R output contains line-by-line the script executed, the resulting outputs, the errors.

So you can ask questions about :
* The R script itself
* The text outputs of its execution (results and eventual errors)

Here are some prompt examples :
* "I am trying to learn how this R script functions. Explain me its global process, and then each steps more in details."
* "Based on this R script and its execution results, what steps could I add to get more detailed error logs ?"
* "Remind me which paramaters are used for 'given task/step/function/etc.' in this R script. And based on the results suggest better parameters."
* "Among all the generated models by this R script, which one is the most accurate ? Show me its parameters and accuracy results."
* Any question about the data the script outputs in the console.

Below are some response examples from the R Script Executor tool.

* Answering which linear model is the best :

* Summarizing :
![R_script_executor_2](/images\R_script_executor_2.png)

* Showing an extract of the data :
![R_script_executor_3](/images\R_script_executor_3.png)

* Error handling :
![R_script_executor_4](/images\R_script_executor_4.png)

## Next Steps

Consider adding the functionality to display and open files generated by R scripts (plots, images, maps, data files, models, etc.).

Alternatively, integrate the tool as-is with an AI agent that can access additional tools for tasks like reading and analyzing various file types within an R project directory.

In the R execution command, you can modify the --no-save and --vanilla paramaters to change the behavior of the script execution (e.g. loading/saving the workspace), or make them accessible from configuration or input.
