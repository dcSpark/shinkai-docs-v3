    In the input box, enter your desired name for your identity. 
    <Note> Based on the length of the name the amount of tokens required to stake will differ. **The longer the name, the less tokens you need to provide**. </Note>

  </Step>
  <Step titleSize="h3" title="Download the JSON file">
    Once you've entered your desired name, proceed forward to the next step, where **you will download a JSON file that backs up your application's keys** (node keys) which will be connected to your Shinkai Identity (the identity itself is tied to your wallet making everything secure/resettable).

    Proceed forward by **confirming** you've downloaded the JSON file, and you will now move forward with submitting the transaction on-chain.

  <Step titleSize="h3" title="Confirm Transaction">

    Once this is done, you should see a screen to `Confirm` staking your KAI tokens to register your identity.
