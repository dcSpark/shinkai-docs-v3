#### Setting up Shinkai
To start using your local AI with Shinkai you will need to install local AI agents or models. 

After initializing your app you will be prompted to **install recommended models** according to your decice specs. You can see the full list of models available by clicking '**Show all models**.'

<Accordion icon="robot" title="AI model guideline according to your RAM">
  As a general rule, here is a brief guideline for model installation **according to your machine specs**: 

    **8GB RAM** ‚û° choose 7B models or smaller.
    _e.g., Gemma2 2b, Codegemma, Falcon, etc._

    **16GB RAM** ‚û° choose 7B, 13B models or smaller.
    _e.g., Llama 3.1 8b, Mistral Nemo 12b, Nexusraven, etc._

    **32GB RAM** ‚û° choose 7B, 13B, 15B, 30B models or smaller.
    _e.g., Codestral, etc._

    **64GB RAM** ‚û° choose 7B, 13B, 15B, 30B models or smaller. You might be able to go higher than that.
    _e.g., Alfred, etc._

    **96GB RAM+** ‚û° any model size should work for you. ü¶æ

<Accordion icon="laptop" title="Which AI model should I install?">
  As a general rule: 
  
  üëü For **lightweight, fast AI needs** (short conversations, basic text generation): Go with _Gemma2 2b_ or _LLaVA Phi 3_.
  
  ‚öñÔ∏è  For **balance between complexity and speed**: _Llama 3.1 8b_ is the best choice.
  
  üß†  For **handling large documents and complex reasoning**: Opt for _Mistral Nemo 12b_, but keep in mind it will require more resources and be slower.

  _Ultimately, your choice depends on the type of content, performance requirements, and hardware limitations you have in your setup._
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="book-open" title="Understanding the 'b' in model names">
  The "**b**" in model names refers to the **number of parameters in the model, measured in billions**. Parameters are the variables the model uses to make predictions, learn language patterns, and generate outputs.

    üëÄ **The more parameters a model has, the more complex patterns it can learn**, but this also means:
    - Increased resource consumption (memory, disk space, computational power)
    - Longer inference time (slower responses, unless optimized)

    üëá Here‚Äôs a general guideline for understanding parameter sizes:

    **2b - 8b models** are smaller, faster, and can handle simpler tasks. They‚Äôre more lightweight and good for smaller, real-time tasks.

    **10b - 70b models** are larger, slower, and better for complex, nuanced tasks. They have better performance on language understanding and generation, but are resource-intensive.

    üíª _You have to keep in mind your own machine's specs when selecting a model._
