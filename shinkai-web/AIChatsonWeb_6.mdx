Switching Agents

In any conversation, you can switch to another agent:

- Click the agent name at the down of the chat  
- Choose another agent from your list  
- The new agent will instantly continue from the same context.

Multi-Agent Conversation Flow

If enabled, agents can collaborate within a chat:

- Agent A does research  
- Agent B creates content  
- Agent C edits or verifies  

Shinkai Web will show which agent performed each step.

Chat Actions

Inside each chat you can:

- regenerate a response  
- copy text  
- duplicate the chat  
- save a chat as a preset  
- export content (when available)  
- pin important messages

Chats are autosaved and can be resumed anytime.

Best Practices

### Be specific  

Clear instructions = better agent performance.

### Provide data  

The more relevant files or context you add, the better the output.

### Try different agents  

Writer, researcher, coder, creator — each has different strengths.
