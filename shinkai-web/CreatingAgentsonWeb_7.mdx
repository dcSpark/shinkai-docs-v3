## Why Create Your Own Agent?

Custom agents allow you to:

- automate tasks  
- define behavior and tone  
- add custom instructions  
- reuse the agent anytime  
- share it with your team or community (optional)

Shinkai Web makes this process fast and simple.

## How to Create a New Agent

To create a new agent:

1. Open \*\*My Agents \*\*from the sidebar  
2. Click **Create Agent** (or “New Agent”)  
3. Choose to start from scratch or choose a template.
3. Fill in the main fields:

   - **Name**  

   - **Description**  

   - **Instructions**

   - \*\*Models \*\*

5. Choose which **tools** the agent can use.
6. Choose which \*\*agents \*\*you want to delegate tasks to other agents you’ve created

Your agent will now appear in your Agents list.

## Agent Configuration Fields

When you create or edit an agent, Shinkai Web allows you to configure:

### **1. Name & Description**

Helps identify what your agent does and how it should be used.

Examples:

- “Research Analyst Agent”  
- “Content Writer (Formal Tone)”  
- “Product Reviewer Agent”

### **2. Personality & Behavior**

Defines how the agent communicates, responds, and thinks.

You can set:

- tone  
- structure  
- level of detail  
- preferred style (formal, casual, technical, concise)  
- constraints (e.g., “Never invent facts”)

### **3. Default Instructions**

These are the core rules the agent will always follow.

Examples:

- “Always return bullet-point summaries.”  
- “Verify sources when possible.”  
- “Make answers concise and avoid fluff.”  
- “Use web search when more context is needed.”

### **4. Prompt Presets**

You can attach reusable prompts that appear as shortcuts in the input bar.

Examples:

- “Rewrite in a formal tone”  
- “Summarize in 5 bullets”  
- “Generate 3 alternatives”  
- “Extract key insights”

These prompts save time and keep workflows consistent.

### **5. Tools**

Tools enable the agent to take actions beyond text generation.

You can enable or disable:

- Web search  
- Image generation  
- Text-to-video  
- Parsing documents  
- External APIs (if supported)

Tools define what the agent _can_ and _cannot_ do.

### **6. Collaboration Rules** _(optional)_  

If the agent will be part of a multi-agent workflow, you can define:

- what tasks it performs  
- when it should hand off work to another agent  
- how it interacts with other roles  

This powers advanced pipelines.

## Running Your Agent

Once the agent is saved:

1. Open it from the **Agents** page  
2. Click **Start Chat**  
3. Send your first message  
4. Use tools, prompts, or files  
5. Adjust behavior if needed

Shinkai Web applies all your custom instructions automatically.

## Editing an Agent

You can modify an agent at any time:

- update instructions  
- change tools  
- add new prompt presets  
- edit personality  
- rename or reorganize  
- enable collaboration

Changes take effect instantly.

## Best Practices

### Keep instructions simple  

Short, clear rules produce consistent behavior.

### Give your agent a strong identity  

Tone + behavior = reliability.

### Use tools intentionally  

Enabling too many tools makes the agent less predictable.

### Combine prompts + presets  

This is the fastest way to standardize workflows.
