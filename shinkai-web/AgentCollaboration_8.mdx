Shinkai Web allows multiple AI agents to work together inside the same workflow.  

This feature lets you combine different skills — research, writing, analysis, editing, creativity — into a single automated process.

## What Is Agent Collaboration?

Agent Collaboration means you can choose two or more agents and connect them in a single shared task.  

Each agent contributes with its own:

- personality  
- instructions  
- tools  
- workflow role (researcher, writer, editor, reviewer, creator, etc.)

This creates a chain of reasoning and production that a single agent cannot match.

## Why Collaboration Matters

With multiple agents, you can:

- automate multi-step workflows  
- mix different skill sets  
- reduce human intervention  
- improve output quality  
- create reusable pipelines  
- scale your productivity in the browser

Shinkai Web makes collaboration accessible to everyone — no coding needed.

## How to Start a Multi-Agent Workflow

1. Open **Agents** from the sidebar  
2. Select **create agent** or choose workflow presets (if available)  
3. Choose to start from scratch or choose a template.
3. Fill in the main fields:

   - **Name**  

   - **Description**  

   - **Instructions**

5. Choose which **tools** the agent can use.
6. Choose which **agents** you want to collaborate (2, 3 or more)
5. Start the workflow  

## Defining Agent Roles

When setting up collaboration, you can define:

- **Primary agent**  

  Leads the workflow and produces the final answer.

- **Supporting agents**  

  Provide info, analysis, content or structure.

## Collaboration Controls

During a multi-agent workflow you can:

- pause the workflow  
- skip an agent  
- regenerate only one agent’s response  
- modify instructions mid-flow  
- add or remove agents  
- restart the workflow with the same setup  

You maintain full control from the browser.

## Tool Usage in Collaboration

Agents in a workflow can use their own tools independently:

- Research agent → web search  
- Creative agent → image generation  
- Video agent → text-to-video  
- Data agent → document parsing  

This makes workflows extremely powerful.

## Tips for Great Collaboration Results

### Keep instructions clear  

Tell the agents exactly what you want each role to do.

### Give context upfront  

Provide files, links, data, or examples.

### Use specialized agents  

Writer + Researcher + Editor always beats a “generalist.”

### Iterate  

You can rerun the pipeline until the output matches your expectations.

## When to Use Agent Collaboration

Use collaboration for:

- content creation pipelines  
- research workflows  
- document analysis + summarization  
- report generation  
- marketing assets  
- long-form content  
- code review / documentation  
- any process requiring multiple expert “roles”
