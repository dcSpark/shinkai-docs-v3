AI agents are more than chatbots — they are autonomous and customizable assistants that can perform tasks, follow instructions, use tools, and work with your data.

In Shinkai, agents are designed to help you get real work done, whether you're using the Desktop App or Shinkai Web.

What makes Shinkai agents different?\
1. They can use tools  

Agents can perform actions such as:

- searching the web  

- generating images  

- generating video  

- reading documents  

- calling external APIs  

- interacting with your data  

Shinkai Web brings these tool-powered agents directly to your browser without any setup.

### 2. They work with your data  

Agents can read files, process documents, summarize content, analyze information, and follow instructions tailored to your workflow.

Shinkai Web supports both local uploads and cloud-synced data.

---

### 3. They are customizable  

You can define:

- personality  

- instructions  

- behaviors  

- allowed tools  

- prompt presets  

- collaboration rules (multi-agent tasks)

---

### 4. They can collaborate  

Multiple agents can work together inside Shinkai Web to complete complex tasks — research, analysis pipelines, content workflows, etc.

---

## Why agents matter

AI agents are becoming the new way to interact with technology.  

Instead of manually performing repetitive tasks, you instruct an agent — and it handles the work for you.

Shinkai makes this accessible from the browser, without installation or configuration.
